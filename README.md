code: Scripts for analyses  
data: Data needed for analyses (that can be shared)   
output: All output/results/visualizations/intermediates    

Each folder is divided into 5 parts:
1) The SNF Analysis
2) Comparing clusters
3) Stability of clusters
4) Out-of-model comparisons
5) Supervised classification analysis

The POND Network has made a commitment to release the data. Data release is controlled and managed by the funding agency, known as the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI). The OBI has estimated that POND data will be released in 2020 via the Brain-CODE portal. Please see https://www.braincode.ca/.
