code: Scripts for analyses  
data: Data needed for analyses (that can be shared)   
output: All output/results/visualizations/intermediates    

Each folder is divided into 5 parts:
1) The SNF Analysis
2) Comparing clusters
3) Stability of clusters
4) Out-of-model comparisons
5) Supervised classification analysis

The PIs of the POND Network (Evdokia Anagnostou, Jason Lerch) have made a commitment to release the data, however this is controlled and managed by the funding agency. The Ontario Brain Institute has given us an expected date of release as Fall 2020. BrainCODE information can be found at https://www.braincode.ca/.
